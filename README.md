This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function expects a specific type of argument (in this case, a string), but it receives a different type (an array of strings). The TypeScript compiler will detect this error and prevent the code from compiling.

The solution shows how to modify the function to correctly handle the expected array of strings.
